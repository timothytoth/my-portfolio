    <h1>Building a Prisoner’s Dilemma Game in C</h1>
    <p><em>2025</em></p>

    <p>
        I wanted to learn C programming.
        So I did.
    </p>

    <p>
    When I first taught myself Python, I remember a quote that changed how I approached learning to code. 
    Most skills are taught by starting with the basics and slowly leveling up. 
    Like riding a bike. You get instructions. You use training wheels. You move to two wheels later.
</p>

<p>
    Coding rarely works that way. 
    It is usually better to jump straight in and build something that challenges you. 
    Have a real project to push through, even if you don’t know how to do everything yet. 
    You learn the parts you need as you go. 
    A lot of programming becomes pattern recognition and repetition anyway.
</p>

<p>
    So that was my plan. 
    I wanted a project that actually meant something to me.
    Game theory was always one of my favorite classes. 
    I use it in real life more often than not. 
    So I decided to learn C by building real game-theoretic situations that a user can play.
    Pick a strategy. Make decisions. See the results in real time.
</p>

<p>
    I started with a classic: The Prisoner’s Dilemma. 
    It’s a simple setup, but it shows trust, risk, punishment, and incentives all in one place. 
    Turning that into a real playable scenario just made sense.
    So, that's what I did
</p>

<p>
    You and an opponent each choose to cooperate or defect.
    But it repeats for many rounds, so strategy matters.
    You learn fast whether you trust too easily or punish too much.
