            <p><b>Optimal Design of Incentive Mechanisms: Badges and Their Role in Open Source Innovation</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Assessed GitHub’s Badges program on open-source innovation using a year-long panel dataset (~800k rows) of 49,000 users, employing inverse probability weighting and difference-in-differences methodology.</li>
                <li>Identified a 7.3% monthly increase in new repository creation among badge earners post-launch.</li>
                <li>Applied Poisson quasi-fixed-effects regression models to measure the role of specific badges on key outcomes such as repositories, issues, and pull requests.</li>
                <li>Documented a 5.1% reduction in forking behavior among badge holders, reflecting a reallocation toward original contributions.</li>
                <li>Proposed improvements to optimize incentives for badge design to enhance user engagement.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Playing to Win: Exploring the Causal Relationship Between Game Features and Positive User Feedback in the Steam Marketplace</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Analyzed 8,500 video games using weighted least squares regression to address heteroscedasticity.</li>
                <li>Determined that games with achievements experience 34% higher positive ratings on average.</li>
                <li>Found early access games received 40% lower ratings, reflecting developmental feedback.</li>
                <li>Revealed that playtime and price correlate with positive user ratings.</li>
                <li>Offered insights for developers on achievements and release timing.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>An Econometric Analysis on Uber Ride Behavior: A Case Study on NYC</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Evaluated congestion surcharge impacts using a refined dataset of 50,000 records from 14M Uber rides.</li>
                <li>Observed a 0.96% reduction in shared ride adoption due to surcharges.</li>
                <li>Found temporal patterns, including increased shared ride usage on Thursdays and evenings.</li>
                <li>Identified trip distance and duration as significant factors for ride adoption.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Data-Driven Exploration of My Spotify Listening Habits</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Utilized Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, IMOTE) to analyze personal Spotify history.</li>
                <li>Created visualizations for weekly trends and peak streaming times.</li>
                <li>Found 65% of listening occurred during weekdays, with peak hours between 3 PM–5 PM.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Identifying Significant Factors Influencing Exonerations in the United States</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Examined exonerations from 1989 to 2021 using the National Registry of Exonerations.</li>
                <li>Determined forensic errors and perjury as major contributors, with coefficients of 1.641 and 0.933.</li>
                <li>Resolved multicollinearity, reducing the mean VIF from 31.81 to 1.88.</li>
                <li>Highlighted systemic flaws, including racial and gender disparities in exoneration rates.</li>
